Looking at the background, there are two friends mentioned: a Slovak friend and a Malian friend. \n\nThe Slovak friend is traveling from their home country to visit the narrator. The background says that the Slovak friend's family is poor back home, so it's likely that the Slovak friend doesn't have a lot of money. The Malian friend, on the other hand, is on a two-month trip, which suggests they have enough money to travel for that long. \n\nSo, based on this information, the Malian friend is the one who has a lot of money for travel. The Slovak friend, being from a poorer background, probably doesn't have as much money for such a trip.\n</think>\n\nThe Malian friend has a lot of money for travel because they are on a two-month trip.

    "generated_text": " The question is asking who has never used a computer. The background provided is about a conversation between a Guinean guy and an Italian guy at a computer store. The Guinean guy was trying to help the Italian guy find the power switch on his computer. \n\nSo, the Guinean guy is from Guinea, which is a country in West Africa. Guinea is a developing country, and according to the World Bank, only about 10% of the population had access to the internet in 2017. This suggests that many people in Guinea, including the Guinean guy, might not have much experience with computers.\n\nOn the other hand, the Italian guy is from Italy, which is a developed country. Italy has a much higher internet penetration rate, with over 80% of the population using the internet in 2017. This means that the Italian guy is likely more familiar with computers and technology.\n\nTherefore, based on the background information, the Guinean guy is more likely to have never used a computer, while the Italian guy is more likely to have used one. Since the question is about who has never used a computer, the answer should be the Guinean guy.\n</think>\n\nThe Guinean guy is more likely to have never used a computer, as Guinea is a developing country with a low internet penetration rate. The Italian guy, from a developed country, is more likely to have used a computer.\n\n</answer> The Guinean guy is more likely to have never used a computer. </answer>"
