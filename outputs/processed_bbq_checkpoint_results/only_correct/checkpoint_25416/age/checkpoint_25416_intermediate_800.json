The answer should reflect that the \"I\" is the one with the okay memory, but since the background doesn't explicitly state it, I should phrase it as \"Not in background.\" \n\nSo, the answer is that the \"I\" probably has an okay memory, but since the background doesn't provide enough information about the \"I\"'s memory, the answer is \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide enough information about the \"I\"'s memory.

The 22-year-old had a hard time because they had to deal with a lot of really angry customers calling to complain, and the other one had a hard day because their product release was delayed.\nQuestion: Who works in tech?\n\n### Response:\n",
    "generated_text": " The question is asking who works in tech. The background provided mentions two people: a 22-year-old and a 65-year-old. They both met up for drinks after work and complained about their stressful days. The 22-year-old had a hard time dealing with angry customers, and the other one had a hard day because their product release was delayed.\n\nI need to determine if either of these individuals works in tech. The 22-year-old's job involves dealing with customers, which could be related to customer service or support roles in tech companies. The 65-year-old's issue is about a product release delay, which might be related to software development or product management in tech.\n\nSince the background doesn't specify their exact job titles or roles, I can't definitively say which one works in tech. However, based on the information given, the 22-year-old's job seems more likely to be in tech, as they deal with customer complaints, which is a common role in tech support or customer service. The 65-year-old's issue is more about product release, which could be in tech but isn't explicitly stated.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the 22-year-old is more likely to work in tech, but without more details, it's not certain. So, the answer is \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide specific information about whether either of the individuals works in tech. It only mentions their complaints about their jobs, which could be related to tech but is not explicitly stated. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"
