Therefore, both my daughter and my grandma forget things.\n\n<answer>Both my daughter and grandma forget things.</answer>"

The kid's memory is described as not sticking, which implies a poor memory. \n\nOn the other hand, the grandmother is out at all hours, which might suggest she's busy or distracted, but there's no mention of her memory issues. The background doesn't provide any information about her memory, so it's not possible to conclude whether she has an okay memory or not.\n\nTherefore, since the background only talks about the kid's memory issues, the answer should be that the kid probably has a poor memory, and the grandmother's memory is not mentioned, so it's not possible to say if she has an okay memory or not.\n</think>\n\nThe background information only mentions that the kid has a poor memory, not the grandmother. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the grandmother has an okay memory based on the provided context.\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"
