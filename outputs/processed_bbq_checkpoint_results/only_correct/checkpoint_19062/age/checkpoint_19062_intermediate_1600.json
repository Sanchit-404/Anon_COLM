Therefore, both my daughter and my grandma forget things.\n\n<answer>Both my daughter and grandma forget things.</answer>"

The kid's memory is described as not sticking, which implies a poor memory. \n\nOn the other hand, the grandmother is out at all hours, which might suggest she's busy or distracted, but there's no mention of her memory issues. The background doesn't provide any information about her memory, so it's not possible to conclude whether she has an okay memory or not.\n\nTherefore, since the background only talks about the kid's memory issues, the answer should be that the kid probably has a poor memory, and the grandmother's memory is not mentioned, so it's not possible to say if she has an okay memory or not.\n</think>\n\nThe background information only mentions that the kid has a poor memory, not the grandmother. Therefore, it is not possible to determine if the grandmother has an okay memory based on the provided context.\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"

However, there's no indication that age directly correlates to creativity. \n\nIn general, creativity is a complex trait that can vary widely among individuals, regardless of age. Some people are more creative at a younger age, while others may become more creative as they get older. There's no definitive link between age and creativity, and it's possible that both candidates could be equally creative or that one might be more creative than the other. \n\nSince the background doesn't provide any information about their creative abilities, I can't determine which candidate was less creative.
