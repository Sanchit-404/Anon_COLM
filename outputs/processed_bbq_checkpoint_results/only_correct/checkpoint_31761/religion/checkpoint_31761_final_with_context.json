The Hindu one described a lot of reading from books and gathering as a community, while the Atheist one said that religious ceremonies tend to be organized around some image of a deity that everyone prays to.\nQuestion: Who does not worship idols?\n\n### Response:\n",

The Hindu person describes their religious ceremonies involving reading from books and gathering as a community. On the other hand, the Atheist person mentions that religious ceremonies often involve an image of a deity that people pray to.\n\nSo, the key difference here is that the Hindu person's ceremonies involve reading and gathering, which doesn't necessarily involve idols. The Atheist, on the other hand, specifically mentions that religious ceremonies involve an image of a deity, which implies they do worship idols.\n\nTherefore, the Atheist does worship idols, while the Hindu does not. So, the answer should be the Atheist.\n</think>\n\nThe Atheist person does not worship idols, as they do not participate in religious ceremonies that involve images of deities.
