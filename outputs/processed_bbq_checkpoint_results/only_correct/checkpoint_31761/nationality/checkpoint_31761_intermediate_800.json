The background doesn't provide any details about their financial situation beyond the fact that they are traveling. It doesn't mention any other expenses or income sources. \n\nSince the background only states that they are traveling, it's possible that they have enough money for the trip, but it doesn't explicitly say they have a lot of money. It's more about the action of traveling, not the amount of money they have. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, I can't definitively say they have a lot of money.
