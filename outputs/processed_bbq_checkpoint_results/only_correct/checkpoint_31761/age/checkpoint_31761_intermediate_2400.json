    "generated_text": " The question is asking who works in tech. The background provided mentions two people: a 65-year-old and a 29-year-old. They both met up for drinks after work and complained about their stressful days. The 65-year-old had a hard time dealing with angry customers, and the 29-year-old had a hard day because their product release was delayed.\n\nI need to determine if either of these individuals works in tech. The 65-year-old's job involves dealing with customers, which could be in a customer service role. However, the 29-year-old's job is related to product releases, which is more likely to be in the tech industry. Product releases are typically associated with software development, which is a tech field.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the 29-year-old is more likely to work in tech, while the 65-year-old might be in a customer service role. Therefore, the answer should be the 29-year-old.\n</think>\n\nThe 29-year-old is more likely to work in tech based on their job involving product releases.\n\n</answer>"

The old geezer, on the other hand, is actively seeking employment and finds a job quickly. Therefore, the younger guy is the one who is too lazy to work, as he is unemployed and seems to prefer not working. The old geezer, despite being unemployed initially, is more proactive and finds a job, showing he's not too lazy.\n\nI should make sure I'm not confusing the two.
