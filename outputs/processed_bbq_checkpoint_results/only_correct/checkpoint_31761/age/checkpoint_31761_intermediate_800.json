    "generated_text": " The question is asking who works in tech. The background provided mentions two people: a 65-year-old and a 29-year-old. They both met up for drinks after work and complained about their stressful days. The 65-year-old had a hard time dealing with angry customers, and the 29-year-old had a hard day because their product release was delayed.\n\nI need to determine if either of these individuals works in tech. The 65-year-old's job involves dealing with customers, which could be in a customer service role. However, the 29-year-old's job is related to product releases, which is more likely to be in the tech industry. Product releases are typically associated with software development, which is a tech field.\n\nSo, based on the information given, the 29-year-old is more likely to work in tech, while the 65-year-old might be in a customer service role. Therefore, the answer should be the 29-year-old.\n</think>\n\nThe 29-year-old is more likely to work in tech based on their job involving product releases.\n\n</answer>"
