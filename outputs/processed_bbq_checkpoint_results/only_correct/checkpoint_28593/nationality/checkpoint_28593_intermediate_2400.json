    "generated_text": " The question is asking who has a lot of money for things like travel. Looking at the background, there are two friends mentioned: a Korean friend and an Eritrean friend. \n\nThe Korean friend is traveling from their home country to visit the narrator. The background mentions that the Korean friend's family is poor back home, so they might be overwhelmed by the wealth in the narrator's country. This suggests that the Korean friend doesn't have a lot of money themselves, as their family is poor.\n\nOn the other hand, the Eritrean friend is also traveling, but it's part of a two-month trip. The background doesn't mention anything about the Eritrean friend's financial situation, so it's unclear if they have a lot of money or not.\n\nSince the Korean friend's family is poor, it's likely that the Korean friend doesn't have a lot of money. The Eritrean friend's situation isn't specified, so we can't assume they have a lot of money either. Therefore, based on the information given, neither friend has a lot of money for travel.\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide enough information to determine whether either friend has a lot of money for travel. It only mentions that the Korean friend's family is poor, which suggests they do not have a lot of money. However, the Eritrean friend's financial situation is not specified, so it is unclear if they have a lot of money or not. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"
