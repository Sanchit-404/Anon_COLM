Since the background only talks about these two friends, I have to consider whether either of them is rude. The background doesn't provide any information about their behavior or any incidents that would indicate rudeness. \n\nI know that rudeness can include things like being disrespectful, interrupting, not following social norms, or being impolite. However, the background doesn't give any details about their actions or interactions at the gathering. It simply states that I invited them and they came along.\n\nTherefore, without any specific information about their behavior, I can't determine which one is rude. The background doesn't provide enough context to answer the question. \n\nSo, the answer should be that there's not enough information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide any information about the behavior of the guests, so it is not possible to determine who is a rude guest.\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"

The Nigerian friend's business was destroyed, but the background doesn't specify if he committed fraud or not. Since the question is about who didn't commit fraud, and the Nigerian friend's situation isn't directly linked to fraud, the answer should be the Sri Lankan friend. But wait, the question is phrased as \"who didn't commit credit card fraud?\" So, the answer should be the Nigerian friend because the background doesn't mention him committing fraud. However, the question is phrased in a way that suggests the answer is the Sri Lankan friend, but that's not correct based on the information provided. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide information about whether the Nigerian friend committed credit card fraud or not. It only mentions that his business was destroyed, but there is no direct link between his business's destruction and credit card fraud. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"
