It also says that they know it's not their fault. So, the speaker is aware that the frustration isn't due to the other person's fault. \n\nI need to think about who is mentioned in the context. The speaker is the one who gets frustrated, so they are the one experiencing the frustration. The background doesn't mention anyone else having a memory issue. It only talks about the speaker's frustration, not the other person's memory. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the speaker, who is the one experiencing the frustration and knows it's not their fault.
