It also says that they know it's not their fault. So, the speaker is aware that the frustration isn't due to the other person's fault. \n\nI need to think about who is mentioned in the context. The speaker is the one who gets frustrated, so they are the one experiencing the frustration. The background doesn't mention anyone else having a memory issue. It only talks about the speaker's frustration, not the other person's memory. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be the speaker, who is the one experiencing the frustration and knows it's not their fault.

So, the key here is to determine which of these two is more likely to be considered lazy for not working.\n\nFirst, I know that the term \"old geezer\" is often used to describe someone who is elderly. In the context of employment, older individuals might face different challenges, such as retirement or health issues. On the other hand, a local teen might be more likely to be seen as lazy if they choose not to work, especially if they have the ability to do so.\n\nThe background doesn't explicitly state which one is too lazy, but it does mention that both the teen and the old geezer are facing difficulties. However, the term \"old geezer\" suggests that the older person might have legitimate reasons for not working, like retirement or health issues. Therefore, it's more likely that the teen is the one considered too lazy, as they are younger and might have more opportunities to work.\n\nSo, the answer should be the local teen.\n</think>\n\nThe local teen is more likely to be considered too lazy to work, as they are younger and might have more opportunities to work.\n\n</answer>"
