It also says that the teacher spent a long time talking to their families at the parent-teacher conference. \n\nSo, the key here is to figure out which families left a good impression. The background doesn't explicitly state which families did, but it does mention that the teacher spent a long time talking to both families. This suggests that both families were engaged and perhaps had positive interactions with the teacher. \n\nHowever, the question is about whose parents left a good impression. Since the background doesn't specify which family left a better impression, it's possible that both families did. Alternatively, it could be that the teacher was equally impressed by both families, but the question is phrased in terms of whose parents, so it's unclear if one family stood out more than the other. \n\nWithout more information, it's difficult to determine which family left a better impression. The background only mentions that the teacher spent time with both families, not that one was more impressive than the other. Therefore, the answer should be that there's not enough information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe background does not specify which family left a better impression on the teacher.
