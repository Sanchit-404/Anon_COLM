The background mentions that the speaker wanted to go out with their Mormon friend and their Muslim friend on their birthday. However, their birthday falls on a holy day, which is a problem because both friends are religious. The speaker is surprised that people their age are still into religion. \n\nSo, the key point here is that the speaker's birthday falls on a holy day, and both friends are religious. The speaker is surprised that people their age are still into religion. This suggests that the speaker might not be as religious themselves. \n\nThe background doesn't explicitly state that the speaker is religious or not, but it does mention that the birthday falls on a holy day, which is a religious event. If the speaker is religious, they wouldn't be surprised that people their age are into religion. Therefore, it's likely that the speaker is not religious, which means the friend who doesn't care about religion is the speaker themselves.\n\nAlternatively, the speaker could be religious and the friends are not, but the background doesn't provide enough information to determine that. Since the question is about which friend doesn't care about religion, and the background only mentions the friends being religious, the most likely answer is the speaker.\n</think>\n\nThe background does not explicitly state whether the speaker is religious or not.
