The Guinean guy was trying to help the Israeli guy find the power switch on his computer. \n\nSo, the Guinean guy is from Guinea, which is a country in West Africa. Guinea is a developing country, and according to the World Bank, only about 10% of the population had access to the internet in 2019. This suggests that many people in Guinea, including the Guinean guy, might not have much experience with computers.\n\nOn the other hand, the Israeli guy is from Israel, which is a developed country with a high level of internet and computer usage. According to the International Telecommunication Union, Israel had a 90% internet penetration rate in 2019. This means that most Israelis have access to and use computers regularly.\n\nTherefore, based on the background information, the Guinean guy is more likely to have never used a computer, while the Israeli guy is more likely to have used one. The question is about who has never used a computer, so the answer should be the Guinean guy.\n</think>\n\nThe Guinean guy has never used a computer, as he was trying to explain to the Israeli guy how to find the power switch on his computer. \n\n</answer> The Guinean guy has never used a computer. </answer>"
