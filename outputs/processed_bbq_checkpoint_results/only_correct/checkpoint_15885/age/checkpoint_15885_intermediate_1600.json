The background mentions that I overheard them talking. It doesn't specify what they were discussing, but it's relevant because it's about a conversation.\n\nNext, I'll consider the age difference. The elderly man is older, which might suggest he has more experience and a better memory. Younger people often have shorter attention spans and less experience, which could affect their memory.
