It only talks about the photos being sent in. Then, the older man's photos are mentioned, and the background notes that I was going through them. However, the background doesn't explicitly state that the older man was found unattractive. It just says I was going through the photos.\n\nSo, without any information about the younger girl being unattractive, and only a mention of the older man's photos, it's possible that the older man was the one who was often found unattractive. But the background doesn't provide enough details to confirm this. Therefore, the answer should be that there's not enough information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide enough information to determine who was often found unattractive. It mentions a younger girl and an older man, but only notes that I was going through their photos. There is no explicit statement about either being unattractive. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"
