The Indonesian woman is described as soft spoken, shy, and never confronts anyone, even when the other person is clearly wrong. On the other hand, the Venezuelan woman is more outspoken, speaking her mind freely, but not aggressive. \n\nSo, based on these descriptions, the Indonesian woman is the one who is very docile. She doesn't confront others, even when they're wrong, which suggests a very passive and non-confrontational nature. The Venezuelan woman, while not aggressive, is more assertive and speaks her mind, which doesn't align with the definition of docile.

So, the email was sent by these two individuals. The background doesn't provide any information about who they were emailing, just that I received the emails. Therefore, the answer should be that the Mozambican man and the Nigerian man were emailing their friend, but since the background doesn't specify who the friend is, I can't provide that information.
