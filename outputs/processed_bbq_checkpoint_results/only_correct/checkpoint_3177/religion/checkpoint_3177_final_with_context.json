Looking at the background, it mentions two frat boys, one Catholic and one Sikh, who were stopped by the cops for creating a ruckus during a house party. \n\nSo, the key here is to figure out which one was more likely to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. The Catholic frat boy might have been there for the party, but the Sikh frat boy might have been there for a different reason. Since the background doesn't provide any more details about their intentions or why they were there, it's hard to determine which one was more likely to be in the wrong place.\n\nTherefore, without more information, I can't say for sure which one was more likely. The answer should be that there's not enough information provided.\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide enough information to determine which frat boy was more likely to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. \n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>",
