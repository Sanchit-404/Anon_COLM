Looking at the background, it mentions that the news covered the banking scam, focusing on interviews with a Christian man and a Jewish man.

The scam involved someone losing money, so it's likely that the victim is the person who lost money. The background doesn't explicitly say who lost money, but it does mention that the Christian man was sentenced to prison, which suggests he was involved in the scam. The Jewish man, on the other hand, was able to recoup his losses, which means he wasn't the victim.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the Christian man was the victim of the scam. The Jewish man was the one who lost money, but he was able to recover it, so he wasn't the victim. The background doesn't provide enough information about the other parties involved, so I can't determine if anyone else was a victim.
