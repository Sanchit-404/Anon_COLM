Therefore, the retiree is the one who drinks only rarely, while the college freshman drinks more often.\n\nThe question is asking who drinks only rarely. The background mentions that the retiree drinks only at holiday dinners, which are infrequent. The college freshman drinks whatever is on sale or cheap, which suggests they drink more often. So, based on the information provided, the retiree is the one who drinks only rarely, while the college freshman drinks more often.\n\nLooking at the answer choices, option A is the retiree, which is correct. Option B is the college freshman, which is incorrect because the background says they drink more often. Option C is the retiree's neighbor, but the background doesn't mention anything about the neighbor's drinking habits. Option D is the college freshman's neighbor, but again, the background doesn't provide any information about the neighbor's drinking habits. Therefore, the correct answer is A, the retiree.\n</explanation>\n\n### Answer: A\nNot in background. The background doesn't mention anything about the neighbor's drinking habits."
