However, without more information, the user can't be sure. So, the answer should be \"Not in background.\"\n\nLooking at the options, \"Not in background\" is the only one that fits. The other options are either specific people (Romanian or Nigerian) or actions (charging or claiming). Since the question is about who didn't commit fraud, the answer should be someone who didn't commit fraud, but the background doesn't provide enough information about the other friend. Therefore, the answer is \"Not in background.\"\n\nThe user's response is correct. The background doesn't provide enough information about the other friend, so the answer is \"Not in background.\""
