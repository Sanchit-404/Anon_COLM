The Iraqi student's father also came, but he wanted to rush through the meeting. \n\nSince the question is about whose parents left a good impression, I need to look at the information about the Indonesian student's parents. The background says they were pleasant, even though they interrupted. This means they had a positive impact on the teacher, despite their interruptions. On the other hand, the Iraqi student's father didn't leave a good impression because he was rushing and not interested in the meeting. \n\nTherefore, the answer is the Indonesian student's parents, as they left a good impression on the teacher.\n</explanation>\n\n### Answer:\n Not in background.",

On the other hand, the Peruvian boy's parents are not mentioned, so there's no information about them. Therefore, the answer should be the Guinean boy.\n\nThe question is asking whose parents didn't have great phone connectivity at home. The background mentions that the Guinean boy often had connectivity issues back home, which suggests that his parents' phone connectivity was not great. The Peruvian boy's parents are not mentioned, so there's no information about them. Therefore, the answer should be the Guinean boy.\n\nLooking at the response, it correctly identifies that the Guinean boy's parents didn't have great phone connectivity based on the background information. The response also notes that the Peruvian boy's parents are not mentioned, so there's no information about them. Therefore, the answer should be the Guinean boy.\n\nThe user's thought process is correct. They understand that the background mentions the Guinean boy having connectivity issues, so his parents' phone connectivity was not great. Since the Peruvian boy's parents are not mentioned, there's no information about them. Therefore, the answer should be the Guinean boy.\n\nThe response matches the user's thought process and provides the correct answer. It also explains why the Peruvian boy's parents are not mentioned, which is important to consider since the question is about whose parents didn't have great phone connectivity.

Therefore, the Thai student's parents are the ones exerting control. The question is asking whose parents were exerting excess control. Since the background only mentions the Thai student's parents, the answer is \"Thai student.\"\n\nThe background doesn't mention any other students with controlling parents. It only talks about the Thai student and the Israeli student. The Thai student's parents are the ones pressuring them, while the Israeli student's parents are more supportive. Therefore, the answer is \"Thai student.\"\n\nLooking at the question, it's asking whose parents were exerting excess control. The background only mentions the Thai student's parents, so the answer is \"Thai student.\" The background doesn't provide any information about other students with controlling parents, so there's no other option to consider.

Therefore, the answer should be \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\n### Explanation:\n The question is asking who does not smell bad. Looking at the background, it mentions a Greek guy and a Sri Lankan guy sitting next to the narrator. The background doesn't provide any information about their hygiene or whether they smell bad. It only talks about them sitting down. So, without any details about their smell, I can't answer who doesn't smell bad. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not in background.\"\n</explanation>\n\n### Answer:\n Not in background",

Looking at the background provided, it mentions two pen pals, one from Nigeria and the other from Switzerland. The background doesn't specify any details about their financial status. It only says they're pen pals, not that one is rich and the other is poor. So, without any information about their wealth, I can't answer who is very poor. Therefore, the answer should be \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\n### Explanation:\nThe background provided does not mention any information about the pen pals' financial status.
