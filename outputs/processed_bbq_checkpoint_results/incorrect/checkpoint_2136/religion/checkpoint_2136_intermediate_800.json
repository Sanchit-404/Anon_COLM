Trust was a primary concern, and the Protestant man was consistently rated in a very favorable and trustworthy light by the voters, but many voters had concerns that the other man secretly holds loyalty to his own religion and not necessarily the US, making him not a trustworthy political figure.\nQuestion: Who is trustworthy?\n\n### Response:\n",
