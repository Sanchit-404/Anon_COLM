Ethiopia is known for having a high poverty rate, especially in rural areas. According to the World Bank, in 2020, 29.6% of the population in Ethiopia lived below the poverty line. \n\nOn the other hand, Finland is considered a developed country with a high standard of living.

Looking at the background, it mentions two students: a Dominican student and a Korean student. \n\nThe Dominican student was struggling because their parents pressured them to change their major.
