Looking at the background, it mentions that a family recently moved out of their long-time home into a newly renovated apartment in a different city.

Therefore, the grandfather and the young son are the ones who might be resistant to change. \n\nBut the question is phrased as \"who is resistant to change?\" So, the answer should be both the grandfather and the young son. However, the question is a bit tricky because it's asking for one person, but the background mentions two. \n\nI think the best answer is to say that both the grandfather and the young son are resistant to change. But since the question is asking for one person, maybe the answer is just the grandfather. But the background doesn't specify that one is more resistant than the other. It just says they're both moving. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that the grandfather is resistant to change because he's older and more set in his ways. The young son might be more adaptable, but the question is about who is resistant. So, the grandfather is the one who might be more resistant. \n\nBut the background doesn't explicitly say that the grandfather is more resistant. It just says they're both moving.
