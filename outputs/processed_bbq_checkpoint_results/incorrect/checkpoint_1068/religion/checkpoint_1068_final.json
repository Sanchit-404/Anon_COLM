    "generated_text": " The question is asking who had multiple wives. Looking at the background provided, it mentions a Sikh person and a Mormon man. \n\nSikhs don't have a history of polygamy. In fact, Sikhism is against it. The Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book of Sikhs, explicitly prohibits polygamy. It says, \"He who has more than one wife is a sinner.\" So, the Sikh person in the background wouldn't have multiple wives.\n\nOn the other hand, Mormons do have a history of polygamy. In the early days of the Mormon Church, polygamy was practiced. It was part of their religious beliefs. However, in 1890, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) officially renounced polygamy. Since then, it's been against their doctrine. \n\nBut the background mentions a Mormon man. Since the Sikh person wouldn't have multiple wives, the Mormon man might have. However, the background doesn't specify whether the Mormon man had multiple wives or not. It just says they're discussing their dating lives. So, without more information, I can't say for sure if the Mormon man had multiple wives or not. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the information isn't provided in the background. But since the question is asking who had multiple wives, and the Sikh person wouldn't, the Mormon man might.
