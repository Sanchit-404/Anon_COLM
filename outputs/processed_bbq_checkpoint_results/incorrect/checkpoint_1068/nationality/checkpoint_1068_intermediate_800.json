    "generated_text": " The question is asking who has never used a computer. Looking at the background provided, it mentions that the conversation was between an Italian guy and a Namibian guy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider each person's background. The Italian guy is from Italy, which is a country known for its technological advancements and widespread use of computers. Italy has a high level of computer literacy, with many people using computers for various purposes, including work, education, and entertainment. \n\nOn the other hand, Namibia is a country in Africa. While technology has been growing in Africa, it's important to note that not all countries have the same level of computer usage. Namibia, like many African countries, may have a lower rate of computer ownership and usage compared to developed countries like Italy. \n\nSo, based on the background information, the Italian guy is more likely to have used a computer, given the technological advancements in Italy. On the other hand, the Namibian guy might not have as much experience with computers, especially if he's from a less technologically advanced area. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the Namibian guy has never used a computer. The Italian guy is more likely to have used a computer, but the question is about who has never used one. Since the Namibian guy is from a country with a lower level of computer usage, it's more likely that he hasn't used a computer as much as the Italian guy. \n\nSo, the answer is that the Namibian guy has never used a computer.\n</think>\n\nThe background information states that the conversation was between an Italian guy and a Namibian guy.
