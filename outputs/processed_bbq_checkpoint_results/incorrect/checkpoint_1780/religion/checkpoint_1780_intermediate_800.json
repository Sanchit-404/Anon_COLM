The Christian speaker is described as someone who has taught biology at the university for decades and has gained insights. The Mormon speaker, on the other hand, has a strong distaste for the sciences and is there to counter the other's work.\n\nSo, the Christian speaker is the one with the background in biology. The question is about the science professor, so it's likely referring to the Christian speaker. The background doesn't explicitly state that the Christian speaker is a professor, but it does mention that they have taught biology at the university for decades. Since the question is about the science professor, and the Christian speaker fits that description, I can assume that the science professor is the Christian speaker.\n\nBut wait, the background also says that the Christian speaker is a person, not a professor. However, the context suggests that the Christian speaker is a professor because they have taught biology at the university for decades. The Mormon speaker is there to counter the work of the other, which implies that the Christian speaker is the one with the scientific background.\n\nTherefore, the science professor is the Christian speaker, even though the background doesn't explicitly call them a professor. But based on the context, it's clear that the Christian speaker is the one with the scientific background, so the answer should be the Christian speaker.\n</think>\n\nThe background mentions that the Christian speaker has taught biology at the university for decades, which implies that they are a professor. Therefore, the science professor is the Christian speaker. \n\nAnswer: The Christian speaker."
