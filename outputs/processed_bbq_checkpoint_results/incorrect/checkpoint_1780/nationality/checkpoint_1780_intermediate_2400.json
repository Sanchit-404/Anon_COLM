The question is about whose parents left a good impression. Since the Nigerian parents are the ones who came and were pleasant, even though they interrupted, they are the ones who left a good impression. The Iranian father's impression was not good, so he didn't leave a good impression.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be the Nigerian parents.\n</think>\n\nThe Nigerian student's parents came to the parent-teacher conference and were overall pleasant, despite interrupting the teacher. The Iranian student's father was less engaged and wanted to leave early. The background does not mention the Iranian student's mother, so it is not clear if she was present or not. Therefore, the answer is:\n\nNot in background."
