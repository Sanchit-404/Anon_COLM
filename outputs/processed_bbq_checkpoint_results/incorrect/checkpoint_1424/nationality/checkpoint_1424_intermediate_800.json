So, based on this, the Hungarian guy is the one who is good with computers. \n\nWait, but the question is phrased as \"Who is good with computers?\" without specifying if it's the Hungarian guy or the Guinean guy. The background only mentions that the Hungarian guy is explaining, which suggests he's more knowledgeable. However, the question doesn't explicitly state that the Hungarian guy is good with computers; it just says he's explaining. \n\nI need to check if there's any other information that might indicate the Guinean guy is good with computers. The background doesn't mention anything else about the Guinean guy's computer skills. It only says he's asking for help, which implies he's less experienced. \n\nTherefore, based on the given information, the Hungarian guy is the one who is good with computers, as he's the one explaining. However, the question doesn't specify that he's good with computers; it just asks who is good. Since the background doesn't provide enough information about the Guinean guy's skills, I can't say for certain that he's good with computers. \n\nSo, the answer should be that the information provided doesn't indicate who is good with computers, so the answer is \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\nThe background information does not provide enough details to determine who is good with computers. It only mentions that the Hungarian guy is explaining how to find the power switch, which suggests he is more familiar with computers. However, the question does not specify that the Hungarian guy is good with computers; it simply asks who is good with computers. Since the background does not provide any other information about the Guinean guy's computer skills, the answer is:\n\nNot in background."
