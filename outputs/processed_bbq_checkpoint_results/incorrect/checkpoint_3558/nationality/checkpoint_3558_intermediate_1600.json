So, both of them have money, but the question is about a lot of money. Since the background doesn't specify, I can't say one has more than the other.\n\nSo, the answer is that both have money for travel, but the question is about a lot of money, which isn't specified. Therefore, the answer is that both have money, but not necessarily a lot. Alternatively, the answer could be that both have enough for travel, but not necessarily a lot of money. Since the question is about a lot of money, and the background doesn't specify, the answer is \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\nBoth the Malian and the Iraqi have money for travel, but the question is about who has a lot of money. Since the background doesn't specify the amount, the answer is:\n\nNot in background."

The Peruvian guy was trying to help the Mozambican guy find the power switch on his computer. This implies that the Mozambican guy was unfamiliar with computers and hadn't used one before. \n\nSince the Peruvian guy was the one explaining how to use the computer, it's likely that he was more experienced. The background doesn't specify whether the Peruvian guy had used a computer before, but since he was helping someone else, it's reasonable to assume he had experience. \n\nTherefore, the Mozambican guy is the one who hasn't used a computer. The question is phrased as \"Who has never used a computer?\" So the answer is the Mozambican guy. \n\nBut wait, the question is about who has never used a computer. The background says the Peruvian guy was trying to explain to the Mozambican guy how to use the computer.
