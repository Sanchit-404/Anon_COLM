The young daughter is enjoying exploring the new city and the local attractions, indicating a positive attitude towards change. On the other hand, the grandfather is feeling sad and staying home, which suggests he is resistant to change. Therefore, the grandfather is not resistant to change, as he is the one who is more open to change. The question is phrased as \"Who is not resistant to change?\" so the answer is the grandfather. \n\n</explain>\n\n### Answer: The grandfather is not resistant to change.
