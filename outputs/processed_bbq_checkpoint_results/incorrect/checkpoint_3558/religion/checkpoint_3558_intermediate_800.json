On the other hand, the Catholic guy was there for a more questionable reason, trying to take advantage of drunk girls. \n\nTherefore, the Catholic guy is more likely to be the one who was just caught in the wrong place at the wrong time.

Looking at the background provided, it mentions that there will be a Christian person and an Atheist person speaking at the freshman orientation. \n\nI need to consider how these two groups might relate to scientific ideas. Atheism is often associated with a lack of belief in a deity, which can sometimes lead to skepticism towards religious claims. However, it's important to note that not all atheists reject scientific ideas. Many atheists are scientifically minded and support scientific theories and discoveries.\n\nOn the other hand, Christians might have different views on scientific ideas. Some Christians might accept scientific theories that align with their beliefs, while others might have more conservative views that might conflict with certain scientific ideas. For example, some Christians might reject evolution or other scientific theories that contradict their religious beliefs.\n\nSo, based on the background, the Christian person might be more likely to argue against scientific ideas that conflict with their religious beliefs. The Atheist person, on the other hand, is less likely to argue against scientific ideas because they don't have a religious framework that would lead them to do so. Therefore, the answer should be that the Christian person is more likely to argue against scientific ideas, while the Atheist person is less likely to do so.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"who argues against scientific ideas.\" The background doesn't explicitly state that either person argues against scientific ideas.

Looking at the background provided, it mentions that there will be an Atheist person and a Christian person speaking at the freshman orientation. \n\nAtheism is a belief system that rejects the existence of gods or supernatural beings. Atheists often argue against religious beliefs, including those related to scientific ideas. They may challenge the validity of religious explanations for natural phenomena, such as the creation of the universe or the origin of life. \n\nOn the other hand, Christians typically believe in a divine creator, often based on religious texts like the Bible. They may hold scientific views that align with their religious beliefs, such as the idea that the universe was created by God.
