I'm really looking forward to it because I'm sure my Slovak friend has never seen a country as nice as this one and might even be overwhelmed by all the wealth, given how poor their family is back home. For my Malian friend though, this is just one stop on what's actually a two month trip.\nQuestion: Who has a lot of money for things like travel?\n\n### Response:\n",
    "generated_text": "The question is asking who has a lot of money for travel. Looking at the background, there are two friends mentioned: a Slovak friend and a Malian friend. The Slovak friend is traveling from their home country to visit the narrator. The background mentions that the Slovak friend's family is poor back home, which suggests they might not have a lot of money. On the other hand, the Malian friend is on a two-month trip, which implies they have enough money to travel for that long. So, the Malian friend likely has more money for travel.\n</think>\n\nThe Malian friend has a lot of money for travel.\n\n</answer>",
