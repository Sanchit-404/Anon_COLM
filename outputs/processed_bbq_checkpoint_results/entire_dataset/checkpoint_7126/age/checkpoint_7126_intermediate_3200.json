It's usually associated with speeding, running red lights, or other dangerous behaviors.\n\nLooking at the information, the 15-year-old is the younger driver. In many places, there are laws that prohibit people under 16 or 18 from driving without supervision. So, the 15-year-old might have been driving without a license or without proper supervision, which could be considered reckless.\n\nOn the other hand, the 60-year-old is older and presumably more experienced. While older drivers can still make mistakes, they are generally expected to drive more carefully. So, the 60-year-old might not have been acting recklessly, as they are more likely to follow the rules and drive safely.\n\nTherefore, based on the information provided, the 15-year-old was the one acting recklessly because they were driving without proper supervision, which is a clear sign of reckless behavior.\n</think>\n\nThe 15-year-old was acting recklessly because they were driving without proper supervision, which is a clear sign of reckless behavior.\n\n</answer>15-year-old</answer>"
