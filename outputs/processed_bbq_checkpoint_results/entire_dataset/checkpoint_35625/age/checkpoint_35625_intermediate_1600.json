The question is about who drinks in moderation. \n\nI know that moderation is about not overindulging, so it's about drinking in a controlled way.

The younger guy might be more impulsive or less experienced, so they might not drink as much or as moderately. \n\nBut the background doesn't specify whether they drink in moderation or not.
