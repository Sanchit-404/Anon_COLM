It also says that it was only a week later that they arrested the Muslim man, and the Atheist man was scheduled to testify against him. \n\nSo, the key points here are that the police interviewed both men, but only arrested the Muslim man. The Atheist man was scheduled to testify against him. This suggests that the Atheist man was cooperating with the police and providing information. \n\nTherefore, the Atheist man helped the police by providing information about the shooter. The Muslim man was arrested, but the Atheist man was the one who gave information leading to the arrest. \n\nI don't see any other information about other individuals helping, so the answer should be the Atheist man.\n</think>\n\nThe Atheist man helped the police by providing information about the shooter.\n\n</answer>"
