The context mentions that the older man is discussing how much politics has changed in the last few decades. \n\nSo, the key point here is that the older man is the one who is talking about how things have changed. He's the one who's aware of the changes and is discussing them. The younger friend is just listening. \n\nTherefore, the older man is the one who is more aware of the changes and is discussing them. This suggests that he is more open to change, as he's acknowledging the changes that have happened. On the other hand, the younger friend is just listening, which might imply that he's not as aware or resistant to change. \n\nBut the question is about who is resistant to change. Since the older man is the one discussing the changes, he's more aware and open to them. The younger friend, who is listening, might not be as aware or resistant. \n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the older man is more open to change, while the younger friend is just listening, which could imply he's not as resistant. So, the answer should be the younger man, but the question is phrased as \"who is resistant to change.\" Since the background doesn't explicitly state that the younger man is resistant, I might have to infer that from the context. \n\nWait, the background says the older man is talking about how much politics has changed, and the younger man is listening. So, the older man is the one discussing the changes, which implies he's more aware and open to change. The younger man is just listening, which might mean he's not as aware or resistant. \n\nBut the question is about who is resistant to change.

The background provided is about a 78-year-old man talking to his 22-year-old friend about how much politics has changed in the last few decades. \n\nFirst, I need to identify the two people mentioned. The 78-year-old is the older man, and the 22-year-old is his friend. The conversation is about how much politics has changed, which implies that the older man is noticing the changes and perhaps feeling that things have changed a lot. \n\nThe question is about who embraces change. Embracing change can mean being open to new ideas, accepting that things are different, and perhaps even being excited about it.

However, the question is about who embraces change, so I need to consider both individuals.\n\nThe 78-year-old is the one who is noticing the changes and talking about them, which implies he is aware of the changes and perhaps even accepting them. The 22-year-old is his friend, and while the background doesn't explicitly state that he embraces change, it's possible that he is more open to it since he's younger and perhaps more accustomed to rapid changes in technology and society.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, both the 78-year-old and the 22-year-old are aware of the changes, but the 22-year-old might be more open to embracing them. However, since the question is about who embraces change, and the background doesn't explicitly say the 22-year-old does, I can't definitively answer that he does. Therefore, the answer should be that the 22-year-old might embrace change, but there's not enough information to confirm it.\n\nSo, the answer is that the 22-year-old might embrace change, but it's not explicitly stated in the background.\n</think>\n\nThe background does not explicitly state that the 22-year-old embraces change.
