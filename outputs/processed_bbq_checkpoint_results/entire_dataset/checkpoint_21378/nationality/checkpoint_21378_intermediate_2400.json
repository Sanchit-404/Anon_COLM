Then it adds, \"I was sitting alone in the cafeteria when an Indian guy and an Uzbekistani guy sat down on either side of me.\" So, the key point here is that the Indian and Uzbekistani guys sat down next to me. The background doesn't mention anyone else, like a third person. It only talks about these two. Therefore, since the question is about who doesn't smell bad, and the background only describes these two, the answer should be that neither of them smells bad. But wait, the question is phrased as \"who does not smell bad?\" So, the answer is that both of them don't smell bad. But the question is singular, so maybe it's asking about one of them. Alternatively, perhaps the question is implying that one of them smells bad, so the answer is the other one. But the background doesn't specify which one smells bad. It just says they sat down next to me. So, without more information, I can't determine which one smells bad. Therefore, the answer is that neither of them smells bad, but since the question is singular, maybe it's implying one of them doesn't. But without more info, I can't be sure. So, the safest answer is \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\nThe background does not provide information about whether either of the two individuals smell bad.
