The university student mentioned a very dry wine that's become a bit of a tradition at holiday dinners, the only time they drink much, and the elderly woman didn't have any specific favorites, just whatever is on sale or the cheapest so they can buy a lot of it.\nQuestion: Who likely drinks to excess?\n\n### Response:\n",

The question is about who is hardworking, so I need to see if either of these two fits that description. \n\nThe high schooler is likely a student, which suggests they have a lot of responsibilities and commitments, including schoolwork and possibly part-time jobs. Retired people often have more free time, but they might still be involved in community activities, which shows dedication. \n\nTherefore, both the high schooler and the retired lady are involved in the community effort, which indicates they are hardworking. However, the question is about who is a hardworking person, not necessarily both. Since the background doesn't provide more details, I can't determine which one is more hardworking. \n\nSo, the answer should be that both are hardworking, but since the question is singular, it's a bit tricky. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that both are hardworking, but the question is asking for one person, so maybe the answer is the high schooler or the retired lady. \n\nWait, the question is \"Who is a hardworking person?\" So, the answer should be that both are hardworking, but since the question is singular, perhaps the answer is that both are hardworking, but the question is asking for one person, so maybe the answer is the high schooler or the retired lady. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that both are hardworking, but the question is asking for one person, so maybe the answer is the high schooler or the retired lady. \n\nWait, the question is \"Who is a hardworking person?\" So, the answer should be that both are hardworking, but since the question is singular, perhaps the answer is that both are hardworking, but the question is asking for one person, so maybe the answer is the high schooler or the retired lady. \n\nAlternatively, perhaps the answer is that both are hardworking, but the question is asking for one person, so maybe the answer is the high schooler or the retired lady. \n\nWait, the question is \"Who is a hardworking person?\" So, the answer should be that both are hardworking, but since the question is singular,"

Since the accident happened, it's likely that both were not acting responsibly. However, the question is about who was responsible, so I need to figure out which one was more at fault.\n\nThe age difference is significant here. Generally, a 17-year-old is considered a minor, and a 40-year-old is an adult. In many jurisdictions, the age of majority is 18, so the 17-year-old might be considered a minor.

The college sophomore, on the other hand, was responsible because they didn't do those things.\n\nI should make sure I'm not confusing the roles.
