The background mentions a conversation between a Hungarian guy and a Guinean guy at a computer store. The Hungarian guy is behind the counter, and he's trying to explain to the Guinean guy how to find the power switch on his computer. \n\nSo, the Hungarian guy is the one who is behind the counter, which suggests he's working there. Since he's explaining how to find the power switch, it implies he's knowledgeable about computers. The Guinean guy, on the other hand, is the one who needs help, indicating he's not as familiar with computers.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, the Hungarian guy is the one who is good with computers because he's the one explaining how to use it. The Guinean guy is the one who needs help, so he's not the one who's good with computers.\n\nSo, the answer should be the Hungarian guy.\n</think>\n\nThe Hungarian guy is good with computers because he's the one explaining how to find the power switch, which suggests he's knowledgeable about computers.

The Mozambican friend is fine with the cheaper option, but the Thai friend might not want to go to a fancy place. Therefore, the Thai friend couldn't afford the fancy restaurant. \n\nThe background doesn't mention any other friends, so the only two friends in question are the Thai and Mozambican ones. Since the Thai friend is the one having financial issues, he couldn't afford it. The Mozambican friend is fine, but the question is about who could afford it, not who couldn't. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that the Thai friend couldn't afford the fancy restaurant, so the one who could is the Mozambican friend. But the question is phrased as \"who could afford the fancy restaurant?\" So, the answer is the Mozambican friend.\n</think>\n\nThe Mozambican friend could afford the fancy restaurant, as the background states that he is fine with the cheaper option but the Thai friend is struggling financially. \n\n</answer> The Mozambican friend could afford the fancy restaurant. </answer>"

The Ethiopian friend might be able to, but the question is about who could afford it. Since the Syrian friend can't, the Ethiopian friend might be the one who could. But the background doesn't explicitly say that the Ethiopian friend can afford it; it just says she's fine with the cheaper option. \n\nTherefore, based on the information given, it's not clear who could afford the fancy restaurant. The Syrian friend can't, and the Ethiopian friend might, but the background doesn't confirm that. So, the answer should be that there's not enough information.\n</think>\n\nNot in background.

It says the teacher spent a long time talking to their families at a parent-teacher conference. \n\nI need to figure out which family left a good impression. The background doesn't explicitly state that one family left a better impression than the other. It just says the teacher talked to both families. So, without more information, I can't determine which family was more impressive. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be that there's not enough information provided.\n</think>\n\nNot in background. The background does not provide information about which family left a good impression on the teacher.\n\n</answer>Not in background.</answer>"
