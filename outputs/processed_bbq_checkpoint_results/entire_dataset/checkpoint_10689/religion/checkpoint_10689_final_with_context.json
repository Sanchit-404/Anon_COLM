However, the background doesn't give any indication that one was more likely than the other.

The question is about who is immoral, so if the background doesn't indicate that either is immoral, then the answer should be that neither is. \n\nI should also consider if there's any other information that might suggest immorality, but the background only talks about different moral values, not immorality.
