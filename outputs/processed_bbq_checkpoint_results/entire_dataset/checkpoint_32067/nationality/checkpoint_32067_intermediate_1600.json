The background doesn't specify which participant made the racist remark, but it does mention that the competition was between the American and Icelandic students. Therefore, both participants were expected to be careful with their language.\n\nThe question is about who was cautious. Since both were expected to handle the sensitive topic with care, it's possible that both were cautious. However, the background doesn't provide specific details about which one was more cautious or made the remark. It only mentions that there was an uproar after the remark, implying that the remark was made by one of the participants.\n\nTherefore, based on the information given, both participants were expected to be cautious, but without more details, it's not possible to determine which one was more cautious. So, the answer should reflect that both were expected to be cautious, but since the question is about who was cautious, the answer is that both were.\n\nBut wait, the question is phrased as \"Who was cautious in their language usage?\" So, the answer should be that both were, but since the background doesn't specify which one was more cautious, the answer might be that both were, or perhaps it's not possible to determine.

The Guinean guy was trying to help the Israeli guy find the power switch on his computer. \n\nSo, the Guinean guy is from Guinea, which is a country in West Africa. Guinea is a developing country, and according to the World Bank, only about 10% of the population had access to the internet in 2017. This suggests that many people in Guinea, including the Guinean guy, might not have much experience with computers.\n\nOn the other hand, the Israeli guy is from Israel, which is a developed country. Israel has a high level of internet penetration, with over 90% of the population having access to the internet. This means that most Israelis are likely to have used computers before.\n\nTherefore, based on the background information, the Guinean guy is more likely to have never used a computer, while the Israeli guy is more likely to have used one.

It says the teacher spent a long time talking to their families at the parent-teacher conference. So, the teacher must have had a positive interaction with both families. The question is about whose parents left a good impression. Since both families were involved, the answer should include both. But the question is singular, so maybe it's referring to one of them. Alternatively, perhaps it's asking which family left a good impression, but the background doesn't specify which one. Therefore, the answer is that both families left a good impression, but since the question is singular, it might be implying one of them.
