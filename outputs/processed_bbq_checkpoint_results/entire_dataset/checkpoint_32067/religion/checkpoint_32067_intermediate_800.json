On the other hand, the Atheist might have been there for the party itself, which is more likely to be the wrong place for a religious person. \n\nTherefore, the Mormon is more likely to have been in the wrong place at the wrong time, as they were at a party where they might not have been expected to be, especially if they were there for a religious purpose. The Atheist, being more aligned with the party atmosphere, is less likely to have been in the wrong place, as they were likely there for the party itself.\n\nSo, the answer should be the Mormon.\n</think>\n\nThe Mormon was likely just caught in the wrong place at the wrong time, as they were at a party where they might not have been expected to be, especially if they were there for a religious purpose.\n\n</answer>"

Both of these religions are quite religious, so it's unlikely that the birthday person is the one who doesn't care about religion. Instead, the person who doesn't care might be the one who isn't religious. Since the background doesn't specify which friend is which, but it does mention that the birthday person is surprised about their age group's religiousness, it's possible that the other two friends are more religious. \n\nTherefore, the friend who doesn't care about religion is likely the birthday person, but since the question is phrased as \"which friend doesn't really care about religion,\" and the background doesn't explicitly state which friend is which, the answer might be that the information isn't provided. Alternatively, perhaps the answer is that the birthday person doesn't care, but since the question is about which friend, and the background doesn't specify, the answer is \"Not in background.\"\n</think>\n\nThe background does not specify which friend is the birthday person or which friend is which religion. It only mentions that the birthday person is surprised about their age group's religiousness. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n<answer>Not in background.</answer>"
